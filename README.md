# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions. 

## Project Structure

- `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis and model building process.
- `creditcard.csv`: The dataset used for this project.
- `best_random_forest_model.pkl`: The saved Random Forest model trained on the dataset.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- colab Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- joblib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn seaborn matplotlib joblib
Usage
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from the CSV file.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling features, and dealing with imbalanced data using SMOTE.
Model Training: Training a Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model performance on the test set.
Model Saving: Saving the best model for future use.
Running the Code
Open the colab notebook credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb.
Run all cells to execute the complete analysis and model building process.
The best model will be saved as best_random_forest_model.pkl.
Example
Below is an example of how to load and use the saved model for making predictions:

python
Copy code
import joblib
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the model
model = joblib.load('best_random_forest_model.pkl')

# Load new data (example)
new_data = pd.read_csv('new_transactions.csv')

# Preprocess the new data (scaling)
scaler = StandardScaler()
new_data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(new_data)

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(new_data_scaled)
print(predictions)
Results
Best Parameters: The optimal hyperparameters found using GridSearchCV.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1-Score on the test set.
Model Performance: The model achieved an accuracy of XX% and a recall of YY% on the test set.
Future Work
Feature Engineering: Explore additional features that could improve model performance.
Model Improvement: Experiment with different algorithms like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or deep learning models.
Model Deployment: Implement a full deployment pipeline using tools like Flask, Docker, or cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure).
